What:

Project Title: Health Insurance Price Prediction

Description:
The Health Insurance Price Prediction project is an application of machine learning techniques to predict health insurance premiums for individuals based on various features such as age, gender, BMI, smoking habits, and region. This project aims to assist both insurance providers and policyholders in estimating insurance costs more accurately. By leveraging historical data and building predictive models, the project seeks to offer insights into the factors influencing insurance prices.

Key Components:

Data Collection: Gathering a comprehensive dataset containing information about policyholders, including their attributes and insurance premiums.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, handling missing values, and encoding categorical variables for analysis.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gaining insights from data visualization and statistical analysis to understand relationships between variables.

Feature Engineering: Creating relevant features and selecting the most important ones for modeling.

Model Building: Developing machine learning models (e.g., regression, decision trees, or ensemble methods) for price prediction.

Model Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.


How:

Technical Stack:

Programming Languages: Python
Libraries and Frameworks: Scikit-Learn, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib/Seaborn, Flask (for deployment)
Machine Learning Algorithms: Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.
Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
